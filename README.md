📍 Project Title: AI-Based Solution for Addressing Plant Diseases in Egypt's Fruit and Vegetable Crops

🧠 Overview
PlantyCare is a smart mobile application developed in Java, aiming to assist Egyptian farmers by diagnosing plant diseases, recommending suitable crops to grow, and suggesting the best fertilizers based on soil and weather data — all powered by AI models.

📱 App Features
🔐 Authentication
Login and Sign-Up pages.
Connected to Firebase for user data storage and authentication.
Keeps a record of the user’s activity and predictions.
🏠 Home Page
The Home Page includes 3 main vertically scrollable options:

1. 🌿 AgriCure
Allows users to upload an image from their device or capture a new photo of the plant.
After submitting the image, the result page displays:
Predicted disease name
The submitted image
A brief description of the disease
Prevention steps to follow
Treatment image and description
All results are saved to Firebase and displayed in a History section at the top of the Home Page. Clicking any image in history redirects the user to its detailed result page.
2. 🌾 PlantPick
Predicts the most suitable crop based on input values:
N, P, K
Temperature
Humidity
